<h3>Although it does make it difficult to talk about what I am interested in during small talk with my co-workers, it does mean that I truly never get bored.</h3>
<h2>Electric Guitar</h2>

<p> Currently I am delving in playing the electric guitar, I only started a few weeks ago, but I already feel incredibly familiar with the instrument, so if you ever want to hear a bit of Red Hot Chili Peppers give me a shout!</p>
<h2>Skateboarding</h2>

<p>Another thing I have been enjoying quite a bit lately is skateboarding, recently I got a pennyboard skateboard. This is my first time skating so as you can expect I have had a few scuffles with the ground already, however if you are persistent you will definitely reap the rewards of this activity as it can be quite exhilirating.</p>
<h2>Gym</h2>

<p>I can absolutely say I love going to the gym, I couldn't always say that but the feeling of getting out there and getting active gives me a feeling that words truely can't describe, that among other benefits such as better sleep, reduced stress, improved mood and others that I cannot remember off the top of my head, although I feel like what was listed is already more than enough to incentivise anyone to start going.</p>
